<p>Today’s research is primarily done in universities, but it was not always so. Before the adoption of the Humboldt model of universities (as institutions of research and teaching) in Germany in the early 19th century and its subsequent generalization, research was mainly organized by academies, which initially operated like clubs funded by their members: an international group of science <strong>amateurs</strong>. I highlight the word amateur here since the professional status of the scientist as it is understood today is a relatively recent historical development.</p>
<p>Although there is a stereotype of the scientist as a mad professor alone in his laboratory, history shows that science has always been a collective effort. The first scientific societies – more like private clubs – were formed in the 1600s in some of Europe’s major cities. Most of these clubs evaluated research and technology on behalf of their monarch, such as The Royal Society of London, the oldest scientific academy still existing. Founded in 1660, the Royal Society became a publishing venue for scientific ideas and reports and was critical in forming a scholarly communication network throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Also founded in 1660 was the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Unlike London’s Royal Society, which was not financially supported by the monarchy, the Paris Academy awarded government stipends to a small group of scientists. These stipends helped legitimize science as a profession while drawing upon the kingdom’s vast resources. By the 1700s, being elected to the Académie des Sciences carried great prestige and financial assurances. As with the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences paved the way for scientific publication by publishing proceedings from its meetings.</p>
<p>Despite these scientists’ supposed interest in attaining enlightenment, they were as discriminatory as anybody else back then, mainly allowing prominent citizens from noble families into these early societies. The first woman was admitted into the Royal Society as late as 1945. There’s no way to measure how much greater our knowledge would be if early scientific clubs had been open to all citizens.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the emergence of the Royal Academy and the Académie des Sciences inspired other aspiring European scientists. Societies became a crucial part of science, allowing researchers to coordinate and evaluate their efforts.</p>

<p>The <strong>institutionalization</strong> of science took place gradually over the last two centuries and greatly accelerated after World War I and World War II, which brought scientific development (which played a decisive role in the outcome of the war) to the forefront of national priorities. While the international scientific community had long existed and transcended geopolitical boundaries, governments realized the importance of developing a national research capacity to decrease their reliance on other countries for the production and application of new knowledge. This contributed to the massification of research and higher education and the proliferation of universities and university professors, effectively operating a complete transition from science as a hobby to science as a profession.</p>

Benefits of the written work
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Written works can be disseminated, copied, verified and referenced. They can contain detailed information, including images and figures. They establish priority in discoveries and can be used to generate a record of scientific knowledge that does not die with the scientists.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you have ever wondered what people did all day before the internet, you probably have the impression (maybe from Bridgerton) that they just wrote letters all day. Thus, unsurprisingly, the earliest scholarly communication occurred through letter writing (“personal correspondence,” if you’re fancy.)</p>
<p>Scientists spread the news of observations and ongoing experiments through letters written to other scientists. Letters were a part of daily life due to convenience, low cost, and lack of censorship. In the 17th century, letters could be sent across Europe within weeks – great speed for the time.</p>
<p>However, even back then, it was too much work to write a letter to each of your scientist friends announcing your most recent discovery. Instead, there were middlemen who collected and distributed these letters to other scientists. One of the most famous of these information gatekeepers was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Oldenburg">Henry Oldenburg</a>, the secretary of London’s Royal Society. At Society meetings, Oldenburg would read aloud the correspondence he received that pertained to scientific matters. For example, the minutes of a Society meeting from 1667 reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“During the recess of the society Mr.&nbsp;OLDENBURG kept up his correspondences with several of the learned men abroad, and particularly HEVELIUS; the letters which passed between them being extent in the LetterBook….</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;OLDENBURG read an extract of Monsr. AUZOUT’s letter to him from Paris, Decemb. 28.1666. N.S. mentioning a new method esteemed by him better than any hitherto practised, of taking the diameters of the planets to seconds, and of knowing the parallax of the moon by means of her diameter.” <span class="citation" data-cites="fjällbrant1997">(<a href="#ref-fjällbrant1997" role="doc-biblioref">Fjällbrant 1997</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another prominent figure was Father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Mersenne">Marin Mersenne</a>, who was at the center of a correspondence network. By visualizing these networks, we are able to observe a part of what we could call the “scientific community” of the time.</p>

<p>Even though it was preceded by a few months by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_des_s%C3%A7avans"><em>Journal des Sçavans</em></a> that eventually became the main dissemination platform of members of the Académie des Sciences, the Philosophical Transactions, which was&nbsp;first published in 1665 by the Royal Society (and still published today), is generally referred to as the first scholarly journal. Its editor-in-chief was Harry Oldenburg. Eventually, these journals came to formalize and organize the process of dissemination of knowledge that had been before relying on informal networks and people like Father Mersenne.</p>

<p>With the growth of science came increased specialization, the creation of new disciplines, scholarly associations, and journals with varying degrees of specialization, as well as national journals to accommodate the growth of the national science systems we mentioned above. In this way, journals play an important role in shaping and structuring research communities and the knowledge that they produce.</p>

<p>Another role of journals that may come to mind is the evaluation of research, which is done through a process known as peer review. Peer review is a central and defining feature of modern science and the scholarly communication process. It is directly related to the Mertonian norm of organized skepticism. It can be defined as “the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies as the producers of the work” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review">Wikipedia</a>). One job of the journal editor or their team is to invite experts (typically two) to evaluate the article and determine if it is suitable for publication in the journal. The peer review process can be <strong>single-blind</strong> (the identity of the author is known to the reviewer, but the reviewer is anonymous), <strong>double-blind</strong> (both the reviewer and the author remain anonymous), or <strong>open</strong> (the identities of all parties are revealed). In recent years, the idea of <strong>post-publication peer review</strong> has been gaining some steam. As the name suggests, this type of peer review occurs only after the article is published (usually on some online platform) and is another form of open and transparent peer review. The main appeal of post-publication peer review is that it allows for the faster dissemination of knowledge (with traditional pre-publication, peer review can take months or years before a submitted article eventually gets published). The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to the recent hype around post-publication peer review as the world needed access to research results to develop and approve vaccines. However, letting everyone publish their work before the peer review process can have perverse effects, such as the potential flooding of the web with bad science. Peer review is a quality control mechanism, after all. This short article in Nature discusses some of the challenges encountered by preprint servers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv.org</a> during the pandemic: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01394-6" class="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01394-6</a>.</p>

<p>Peer review, as it is conducted today (by external reviewers invited by the editor), is a relatively new thing in science. For hundreds of years following the creation of the Philosophical Transactions, the journal editors were the ones who handled the quality control of the works they published. However, as science became more and more institutionalized and the number of researchers and research areas grew, it became impossible for editors to handle all that work. They could also not be experts in all the research areas their journals would publish. So, they turned to external reviewers for help.</p>
<p>Some eminent researchers, like Albert Einstein, were not huge fans of this new process. When the Physical Review journal editor rejected one of his papers based on the external reviewers’ comments, this was Einstein’s response:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We (Mr.&nbsp;Rosen and I) had sent you our manuscript for publication and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed. I see no reason to address the—in any case erroneous—comments of your anonymous expert. On the basis of this incident I prefer to publish the paper elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>Respectfully</em>,</p>
<p>P.S. Mr.&nbsp;Rosen, who has left for the Soviet Union, has authorized me to represent him in this matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, the reviewer turned out to be right, and Einstein corrected the paper before it was published in another journal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Even though peer review is now a standard and widely accepted element of the scholarly communication process, many researchers are still critical of the process. Here are some of the main criticisms of peer review.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Peer review is <strong>arbitrary</strong>. The outcome of the peer review is difficult to predict, and the same publication might receive a completely different assessment depending on the reviewers involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer review is <strong>biased</strong>. There are many ways in which reviews may be biased; prominent scientists get more favourable reviews than those who are unknown. Gender, ethnicity, topics, methods, and innovativeness are all factors that may affect the outcome of the review in one way or another.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer review <strong>does not detect errors or fraud</strong>. In the last two decades, we have seen a surge in the retractions of peer-reviewed articles found to be erroneous or fraudulent, leading some people to argue that the fact that these papers made it past peer review demonstrates that the process does not work.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer review is <strong>exploitative</strong>. Peer review is performed voluntarily by members of the scientific community. It also provides little returns in symbolic capital for the reviewer. However, they help increase the quality and reputation of the journals, many of which are owned by corporations that extract large profits from the reputation of their journals.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer review is <strong>slow</strong>. It may take time for an editor to find suitable reviewers for a paper. Then, reviewers are usually given about a month for their review. Then, the comments are sent to the authors, who are invited to submit a response to the reviewers and an updated manuscript. This process is repeated until the manuscript gets accepted for publication. Here is a meme to illustrate just how slow peer review can be:</p></li>

<p>This is probably a good time to introduce the dreaded and infamous reviewer 2. Indeed, if it takes such a long time for a paper to get published, it is a well-known fact that it is partly because of reviewer 2. But&nbsp;<strong>who is reviewer 2?</strong></p>

<p>Everyone fears reviewer 2, but what they fear even more is <strong>being</strong> reviewer 2.</p>

<p>Peer review is not only a part of the scholarly communication process but occurs in almost all stages of the research process (e.g., research funding) and throughout the reward system of science (hiring, tenure, promotion, honorific awards, etc.).</p>

<p>Journals have different levels of prestige (symbolic capital) and are often used as a proxy for the quality of publications, researchers, and institutions. Publishing in some specific journals can be determinant and even make or break scientific careers, bring universities up in university rankings, etc. For example, the Financial Times produces a <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/home/masters-in-business-administration">business schools ranking</a> using the number of articles published in 50 top journals as an indicator of research excellence.</p>
<p>In bibliometrics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">Journal Impact Factor</a> (JIF) is one way in which the prestige of a journal is quantified and measured (based on the average number of citations papers published in the journal have received). To appreciate the importance of a journal, one does not have to be a member of the community or be able to recognize the prominence of the editorial board members or the quality of the content published by the journal. One just needs to know that 5 is a higher number than 4 and hang on to the belief that this number accurately represents a journal’s quality or prestige so that a journal with a JIF of 5 is better than a journal with a JIF of 4. By extension, a scientist who publishes their work in a journal with a JIF of 5 has to be a better scientist than one who publishes in a journal with a JIF of 4. This is a widely criticized use of the JIF, which was designed to help academic librarians with collection development, not to evaluate science or scientists.</p>

<p>A handful of large corporations own most of the journals published today <span class="citation" data-cites="larivière2015">(<a href="#ref-larivière2015" role="doc-biblioref">Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015</a>)</span> that control one of the most profitable industries of modern times. This is primarily done by selling back to the scientific community (mainly through academic libraries) the product of its free labour (research, peer-review). We will address this topic again in a later chapter about open access publishing.</p>
